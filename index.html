      <h1>Material Recording</h1>

      <p><strong>Material Recording is an ongoing practice documenting how wood behaves under constraint, pressure and time.</strong><br>
      Objects are produced, exposed to controlled conditions, and recorded as their material state changes.<br>
      The work focuses on behaviour rather than form, and on observation rather than outcome.<br>
      It is not a collection of finished objects, but a system for recording material response.</p>

      <h2>Method overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constraints</strong> Objects are produced with defined geometric and material constraints that influence stress and movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Interventions</strong> Selected actions—structural, thermal, chemical, or surface-based—are applied to alter how the material behaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure</strong> Cracking, rupture, deformation, and collapse are treated as recorded events rather than defects.</li>
        <li><strong>State</strong> Each object is observed over time and documented as active, stable, or resolved.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Records</h2>
      <p>
        <a class="btn" href="records.html">View recorded objects →</a><br>
        An indexed view of Material Recording entries, organised by material, failure class and state.
      </p>

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>Periodic notes on Material Recording, object states and ongoing research.</p>
