      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Studioaprile is the practice of <strong>Dario D’Aprile</strong>, an artist based in Brixton, South London.</p>

      <p>The work is structured around <strong>Material Recording</strong>, an ongoing practice documenting how wood behaves under constraint, pressure, and time. Objects are produced, exposed to controlled conditions, and recorded as their material state changes. The focus is on observation rather than outcome, and on material behaviour rather than form.</p>

      <p>Prior to Material Recording, D’Aprile’s work spanned photography, visual art, and sculptural research. He holds a master’s degree in design and has exhibited internationally. Earlier projects examined spatial perception, landscape, and human–environment relationships, providing the groundwork for later investigations into material systems and constraint.</p>

      <p>Alongside his artistic practice, D’Aprile spent over two decades working in technology and product development. This background informs the procedural structure, documentation logic and system-based approach that underpin Material Recording.</p>

      <p>Studioaprile operates as a working practice rather than a studio brand, with research, production, and documentation taking place in parallel.</p>
