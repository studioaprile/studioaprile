                    <p>
                        Dario D'Aprile is an artist and woodworker based in Brixton, South London. 
                        His work celebrates the intricate dialogue between form, material and impermanence. With a master’s degree in design, Dario began his artistic journey as a photographer and psychogeography artist, exhibiting in Milan, New York and Bologna. His early work explored the connections between people and their environments, uncovering hidden narratives of movement and memory.

                        After a successful corporate career, Dario returned to his artistic roots in 2023, picking up a chisel and operating a lathe for the first time. He re-trained as a carpenter and honed his craft under the guidance of an established cabinet maker before transitioning to sculpture, beginning with carving and evolving into turning. His bowls, vessels, and plates are more than crafted objects; they are the result of painstaking toil and a deep collaboration with the wood itself.

                        Dario’s sculptures aren’t simply turned on the lathe—they are born from a process of experimentation and exploration. He delves into the drying properties of wood, oxidation techniques, heat deformation and their impacts on each piece. His work is a dance with the material, where the wood’s natural tendencies dictate the shape and Dario’s role is to guide rather than impose.

                        Deeply inspired by the Japanese philosophy of Wabi-sabi, Dario embraces imperfection, transience and the beauty of natural evolution. Each of his creations reflects a harmonious balance between the artist’s vision and the wood’s organic transformation, resulting in pieces that continually evolve and invite reflection on the fleeting nature of beauty.
