                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Studioaprile is Dario D’Aprile, an artist and maker based in Brixton, South London. His work explores the intricate dialogue between form, material, and impermanence.</p>
                    <p>With a master’s degree in design, Dario began as a photographer and visual artist, exhibiting in Milan, New York, and Bologna. His early works examined the relationship between people and their environments, uncovering hidden narratives of movement and memory.</p>
                    <p>After a successful 20-year career in technology, he returned to his artistic roots in 2023, training as a carpenter before evolving into sculpture. His bowls, vessels, and plates embody a meticulous dialogue with wood, guided by its natural properties.</p>
                    <p>Deeply influenced by the Japanese philosophy of <em>wabi-sabi</em>, Dario embraces imperfection and transience, creating pieces that evolve over time.</p>
