            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Studioaprile is the practice of Dario D’Aprile, an artist and maker based in Brixton, South London.
The work investigates material behaviour under stress, loss of control, and time-based change.

Objects are produced through defined protocols rather than fixed outcomes. Wood is pushed beyond structural tolerance, allowed to deform, crack, or fail, and documented without corrective intervention. Each piece is presented as a material record of a specific condition rather than a resolved form.

Trained in design, D’Aprile began his career as a photographer and visual artist, exhibiting internationally. After two decades working in technology, he returned to making in 2023, training as a carpenter before moving into sculptural turning and material experimentation.

The practice centres on unstabilised, often reclaimed timber. Change is not arrested unless specified by the protocol. Cracking, distortion, and instability are treated as outcomes rather than defects.

Influenced by wabi-sabi, but operating through a contemporary, process-led lens, Studioaprile’s work exists between craft, sculpture, and material research. Objects continue to evolve after making, and their final state is not predetermined.</p>
