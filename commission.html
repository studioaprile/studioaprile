      <h1>Commissions</h1>

      <p>Studioaprile accepts a <strong>limited number of commissions</strong> where a specific request can be addressed through the working methods of the practice.</p>

      <p>Commissioned works are developed slowly and under defined constraints, using primarily <strong>fallen or reclaimed wood</strong> sourced through local recovery rather than commercial supply. Material availability, condition, and prior stress histories are treated as active variables, and directly influence form, behaviour, and outcome.</p>

      <p>Commissions may take the form of <strong>single bowls or vessels</strong>, urns with clearly defined size and intent, or small groups of related objects. While a commission may begin from a functional requirement or contextual brief, the final form is not pre-designed. Objects are produced, exposed to controlled conditions, and allowed to retain movement, deformation, and surface change over time.</p>

      <p>The outcome is always a one-off object shaped by material response rather than optimisation or finish. Variation, cracking, and irregularity are integral to the work and are neither corrected nor disguised.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>An initial conversation to clarify intent, context, and constraints</li>
        <li>Material selection and a rough proposal based on availability</li>
        <li>Confirmation and production scheduling</li>
        <li>Making, with limited progress updates</li>
        <li>Completion, review, and delivery</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Commissioned objects will continue to evolve after completion.</p>

      <p>For commission enquiries, please email <a href="mailto:info@studioaprile.com"><strong>info@studioaprile.com</strong></a> with a short description of your idea, intended use, and any material preferences.</p>
